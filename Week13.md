# Munseum Trip

What I find it really interesting is that many of my friends found the exhibition very boring while I felt it incredibally attractive. During our discussion, it became apparent that the stark difference in our perceptions of the exhibited works was largely attributed to our differing academic backgrounds. As a student of product design, many of the showcased works were considered trite and unoriginal, given them exposure to countless similar designs. However, as a game design student, I was able to approach certain theoretical concepts and ideas from a fresh perspective. A case in point is Gaetano Pesce's 1969 iconic creation, the "Up" chair.

Indeed, one of the most intriguing aspects of the "Up" chair is its symbolism and the message that it conveys. Firstly, the form that emerged was no typical seat. Its bulbous shape, inspired by silhouettes of ancient fertility goddesses and accompanied by an affixed ottoman resembling a ball and chain, was rife with meaning. "It’s an image of a prisoner," Pesce says. "Women suffer because of the prejudice of men. The chair was supposed to talk about this problem." Pesce's intention was to create a piece of furniture that spoke to the struggles of women and their oppression in society. The chair's unconventional shape and the addition of the ottoman resembling a ball and chain serve as a commentary on the societal expectations and limitations placed on women. While the symbolism and messaging in the "Up" chair may seem cliché in modern design discourse, it's important to remember that this piece was created over 50 years ago and carries significant cultural and historical significance. In its time, the "Up" chair was a groundbreaking work that challenged the norms of furniture design and brought attention to important societal issues.

It's also worth noting that while the chair's design may not conform to contemporary standards of sustainability, practicality, comfort, durability, or cost-effectiveness, it remains a powerful example of how design can be used to convey ideas and spark conversation. The "Up" chair continues to inspire and influence contemporary designers, and its legacy as a symbol of social commentary and artistic expression remains strong. Artworks are not intended to solve the problem at its root, but to express an attitude that will make people pay attention and start thinking about it.

In short, while some may view the "Up" chair as outdated or lacking in certain practical considerations, it remains a significant piece of design that exemplifies the power of creativity and expression in shaping cultural discourse.
