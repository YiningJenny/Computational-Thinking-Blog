# Munseum Trip

What I find it really interesting is that many of my friends found the exhibition very boring while I felt it incredibally attractive. During our discussion, it became apparent that the stark difference in our perceptions of the exhibited works was largely attributed to our differing academic backgrounds. As a student of product design, many of the showcased works were considered trite and unoriginal, given them exposure to countless similar designs. However, as a game design student, I was able to approach certain theoretical concepts and ideas from a fresh perspective. A case in point is Gaetano Pesce's 1969 iconic creation, the "Up" chair.

Indeed, one of the most intriguing aspects of the "Up" chair is its symbolism and the message that it conveys. Firstly, the form that emerged was no typical seat. Its bulbous shape, inspired by silhouettes of ancient fertility goddesses and accompanied by an affixed ottoman resembling a ball and chain, was rife with meaning. "It’s an image of a prisoner," Pesce says. "Women suffer because of the prejudice of men. The chair was supposed to talk about this problem." Pesce's intention was to create a piece of furniture that spoke to the struggles of women and their oppression in society. The chair's unconventional shape and the addition of the ottoman resembling a ball and chain serve as a commentary on the societal expectations and limitations placed on women. While the symbolism and messaging in the "Up" chair may seem cliché in modern design discourse, it's important to remember that this piece was created over 50 years ago and carries significant cultural and historical significance. In its time, the "Up" chair was a groundbreaking work that challenged the norms of furniture design and brought attention to important societal issues.

It's also worth noting that while the chair's design may not conform to contemporary standards of sustainability, practicality, comfort, durability, or cost-effectiveness, it remains a powerful example of how design can be used to convey ideas and spark conversation. The "Up" chair continues to inspire and influence contemporary designers, and its legacy as a symbol of social commentary and artistic expression remains strong. Artworks are not intended to solve the problem at its root, but to express an attitude that will make people pay attention and start thinking about it.

In short, while some may view the "Up" chair as outdated or lacking in certain practical considerations, it remains a significant piece of design that exemplifies the power of creativity and expression in shaping cultural discourse.

Furthermore, the use of non-traditional materials in the "Up" chair's production was a bold move that challenged the status quo of furniture design. Pesce's use of polyurethane foam allowed him to experiment with form and create a chair that defied the conventions of traditional furniture design. The chair's unique shape, combined with its bright, eye-catching colors, ensured that it would stand out and remain memorable to anyone who encountered it.

Another noteworthy feature of the "Up" chair is its versatility. While its form may not lend itself to a traditional sitting experience, the chair's ability to be positioned in various ways allows for a range of sitting options. The chair's soft foam material provides a comfortable, cocoon-like experience that encourages relaxation and introspection.

In conclusion, Pesce's "Up" chair is a prime example of how design can be used to convey powerful messages and challenge societal norms. Its unique form, use of non-traditional materials, and versatility make it a standout piece of furniture that has endured the test of time. While there are valid criticisms of the chair's sustainability, practicality, comfort, durability, and cost, it remains a thought-provoking piece of design that continues to inspire and captivate audiences.


In conclusion, while Gaetano Pesce's "Up" chair may be a design icon, it is not without its flaws. Its environmental impact, unconventional design, lack of practicality, comfort issues, durability concerns, and high price tag are all valid criticisms. Nonetheless, the chair remains a bold and daring piece of design that has stood the test of time and continues to inspire designers to push the boundaries of conventionality.
