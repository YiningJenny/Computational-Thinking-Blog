I'd like to skip the part about crip and focus on the difference itself. Here I have a social background to talk at beginning. As we all know, there is a big gap between chinese and western culture. For example, respect for the elderly is a traditional Chinese virtue and kids in China are taught from an early age that "if you see an elderly person on a bus, you should give up your seat for them". In Western countries, and even in Japan, elderly people on buses feel offended by given seats because they do not consider themselves 'disabled'. Another example, in China a few decades ago, some boys held hands in the street, they hugged or kissed on the cheek. Nowadys, where the LGBTQ+ community is widely recognised, modern people may think of them as same-sex couples, but they are really just ordinary friends who just have a more intimate way of expressing their feelings. I have a male 'straight' friend (who has a girlfriend) who was once mistaken for a gay man because of his intimate behaviour with boys and had to change his nature and become the 'norm'. There are too many labels and categories in society, which is not a bad thing, but some people don't want to be labelled (but often "not wanting to be labelled" becomes a new label). It is these labels that widen the differences between people, and people always identify less with different labelled groups. But exclusion is in the human genes, I think that to create a space where differences are embraced requires a completely different social system, one that exists only in the ideal. So I will describe below how I imagine the 'perfect' system would be created.

This new space station is made up of children. Only children under 12 can be seceleted as crew. People in real world have more patience and think more about children, especially different children, because they believe differences would disappear as they get older. Everyone was once a child, so everyone must have been "forcibly" taught to do the "right" thing. But actually many things are just abnormal, not incorrect. It’s normal to be abnormal for kids. As a result, the way to create a world that differences are embraced is not eliminating differences, instead, differences do not exist. In my opinion, different labels and tags are at the root of differences. There are more and more classification of the people in the real world.  But in children’s world, there is no classification of people, they have not been taught to be different groups. So my rule is to change the world around children instead of change themselves.

There is no hierarchy or affiliation in this new world that made up for children, only organisers and partners (there may be only one member in the organisation, then this person is both the organiser and the participant who needs to rule himself). They learn sciences, mathematics, psychology, architecture, medicine, media, agriculture……They learn everything they need to know to design, and then they design things for themselves. When they are not studying, they play sports or just play, they can think in different ways during the progress and they get more creative.

Every couple of days they exchange ideas and share something different that they have thought of. It can be objects that they discover, it can be a wired phenomenon, it can also be a new way of looking at ordinary things.

Every week they meet together, prepare refreshments and snacks. They sit in a circle and praise members for what they can learn from each other and point out the uncomfortable things that others do (it means the thing that really annoying). No one is perfect and they learn from mistakes.  When they understand that mistakes are normal, they develop as risk takers and become more empathetic and patient when their peers make mistakes. In this part they can also foster empathy and understanding. Through sharing and discussion they develop relationships with members and a deeper understanding of how they can add to value from others.

Every six months they have elections by anonymous ballot. Awards can be given for "most caring member", "outstanding contribution", "best sleeping member", “most funny member”, etc. After the awards ceremony, they have after party, they can shout out to celebrate every member that they think incredibly awesome. This will inspire their inner passions and truly embrace the unique gifts in each individual.

As the years went on, the space station made up of children continued to grow and evolve, welcoming new members to join in to create a better world for all. And as they grow, they knew that they had created something truly special, a community that celebrated and valued difference in all its forms.
