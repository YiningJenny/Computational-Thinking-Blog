# I consider Victoria Modesta too be a Transhuman artist.

Firstly, her music video "Prototype" features several elements of transhumanism, the belief in using technology to enhance human abilities and experience. Evidence as below:

#### 1. Prosthetic leg

The most obvious element of transhumanism in the video is Victoria's prosthetic leg. It's not just a functional replacement for a lost limb; it's a striking fashion statement that transforms Victoria's body into a work of art. The prosthetic leg is adorned with crystals, and it's designed to be both beautiful and functional.
