# I consider Victoria Modesta to be a Transhuman artist.

Firstly, her music video "Prototype" features several elements of transhumanism, the belief in using technology to enhance human abilities and experience. Evidence as below:

#### 1. Prosthetic leg
The most obvious element of transhumanism in the video is Victoria's prosthetic leg. It's not just a functional replacement for a lost limb; it's a striking fashion statement that transforms Victoria's body into a work of art. The prosthetic leg is adorned with crystals, and it's designed to be both beautiful and functional.

#### 2. LED lights: 
Another element of transhumanism in the video is the use of LED lights. Throughout the video, Victoria's prosthetic leg and other parts of her body are illuminated with bright LED lights that change color and pattern. This use of technology to enhance the human body is a key aspect of transhumanism.

#### 3. Cyborg aesthetic: 
Victoria's overall aesthetic in the video is very cyborg-like. She wears metallic clothing and accessories, and her makeup and hair are styled to look futuristic and otherworldly. This aesthetic is a nod to the transhumanist idea of merging human and machine to create a new kind of being.

#### 4. Body modification: 
Victoria's overall message in the video is one of body modification. She sings about breaking free from societal norms and embracing individuality, which is a key aspect of transhumanism. The idea of using technology to modify the body and create a new kind of human is all about embracing individuality and transcending the limitations of the human form.

What's more, Victoria Modesta The singer herself has elements that prove she is a Transhumanist artist. As a living human being, Victoria Modesta uses various technologies and modifications in her personal image and performances to present an image that emphasizes transcending human physical limitations. Therefore, I believe she is a Transhuman artist.

For example, Victoria Modesta underwent amputation surgery at birth due to a disability in her feet, and later chose to use prosthetics to replace her original legs, making her image more prominent and using it as one of her brand identities. She also said in an interview: "I'm always making changes to my body because I want to be the person I want to be."

In addition, Victoria Modesta often uses various high-tech devices and props, such as prosthetics, luminous costumes, and body attachments in her music and performances to create a futuristic image, emphasizing human reliance on technology and body modification. For example, in her music video "Prototype," she dances in a futuristic world wearing luminous costumes and prosthetics, emphasizing the fusion of technology and human body.
