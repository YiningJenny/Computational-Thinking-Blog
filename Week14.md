# Before doing any text reading:

Literacy for me is a particular way for people to express feelings and thoughts. Usually people talk, maybe add some hand movements or body language to the conversation to support the expression. However, literacy is more organised and more rigorous. It has been shaped by more thought, perhaps combining more knowledge from different fields. And this is the most fascinating part of literacy. People think in different ways, especially in different languages. No work of literature can accurately convey the author's original meaning by a mere direct translation. The author of a literary work writes down words as an output of ideas, while the reader reads and thinks about them as an input of ideas, they communicate across space and time through literacy (which sounds so romantic). Sometimes when I read the text sharing the same ideas with me, I feel myself resonating with the author’s spirit.
As for calling computer programming a literacy, I think it is because there are bunch of people all over the world using computer language (such as C#, Java, Python .etc). Computer programming in my opinion is a universal language, people can communicate through programming. Just like normal literacy, programming is also gorgeous and beautiful for people who can get to each other’s soul. To summarise, both literacy and programming literacy are another languages as tools for communication, expressing passions and emotions.
