# Before doing any text reading:
Literacy for me is a particular way for people to express feelings and thoughts. Usually people talk, maybe add some hand movements or body language to the conversation to support the expression. However, literacy is more organised and more rigorous. It has been shaped by more thought, perhaps combining more knowledge from different fields. And this is the most fascinating part of literacy. People think in different ways, especially in different languages. No work of literature can accurately convey the author's original meaning by a mere direct translation. The author of a literary work writes down words as an output of ideas, while the reader reads and thinks about them as an input of ideas, they communicate across space and time through literacy (which sounds so romantic). Sometimes when I read the text sharing the same ideas with me, I feel myself resonating with the author’s spirit.
As for calling computer programming a literacy, I think it is because there are bunch of people all over the world using computer language (such as C#, Java, Python .etc). Computer programming in my opinion is a universal language, people can communicate through programming. Just like normal literacy, programming is also gorgeous and beautiful for people who can get to each other’s soul. To summarise, both literacy and programming literacy are another languages as tools for communication, expressing passions and emotions.

> ## Live coding gives us a way to think otherwise about coding--what it can be, rather than what it is.

I think every languages represent a different culture, people think in different way under different cultures. To campare with literacy, coding has shorter history, but there is code culture. Code is also a language, which means people think in coding way when they programming. This help people to open mind and become more creative. Many old people cannot use smart phone, because this is new technology for them. Actually, it does not really matter if they know nothing about electronic products. They read printing books, they drink hand-ground coffee, they can literally live in a more natural life. But some of the elder know programming things, then they can even design video games. For example, not alone is a video game designed by a group that work in deep partnership with [40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members] . I believe the area they are living do not really need them to understand code for surviving, but they still try to infuse their values and mythologies into a game by a more spreadable way. The most impressing part of the game is not the core  mechanic, nor game interface. The important thing is the social context, the meaning behind the game for such a group of people get in touch with code. 
> ## Live coding
live coding can directly show the audience how does a project work in the background, which makes the thoughts of coder transparency. This is a good way for artisit to share opinions, they can say "Look I can do this kind of thing with code" instead of just display a perfect work. Any kind of text can be ambiguous in the absence of context, not to mention a more abstract work of art. I always feel confused when I see an artwork in exhibition before reading the illustration. However, live coding makes artwork much more understandable because code is more logical and precisely. It does not create any misunderstandings. Audience can decode while enjoying the performance, and be more immersed. The live coding process may not be perfect, and the code may even report errors during the performance. But it's the randomness of live performance, which is great fun, just like an orchestra doesn't play CDs on stage. Pre-recorded must be perfect, but people are not machines, and improvisation is the most fascinating part of live performance.
