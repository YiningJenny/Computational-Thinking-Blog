## 1. How is this computational, according to you?
I don't think this work has anything to do with computational in terms of artistic expression
## 2. What topic is the piece/artist exploring, according to you?
I think it's a room designed for children, or a space the author remembers herself spending time in during her childhood
## 3. What other pieces of art are exploring a similar topic, and how are these pieces of art exploring the topic differently?
I think that Figure 3 might be exploring similar themes, but it has a much more somber and closed-off vibe overall. It's almost like a physical manifestation of the barriers we put up to isolate ourselves from the outside world, creating a small space for introspective thought and reflection. The fortress-like structure appears very sturdy, perhaps suggesting that once someone has made up their mind, they won't be easily swayed by others.

If the previous work was lively and engaging, this piece is calm and isolated. It seems to be more about individualism and the need for personal space and introspection. The use of heavy and rough metal materials adds to the feeling of sturdiness and isolation.

The design of this piece gives the impression of a closed, introspective space that shuts out the outside world. The strong, sturdy metal structure suggests a sense of isolation and protection, perhaps emphasizing the importance of feeling secure in our own thoughts and convictions.

Of course, as with any work of art, there's always room for interpretation and differing perspectives. Some might see the fortress-like structure as a symbol of strength and protection rather than isolation, or read other meanings into the piece. But regardless of the specifics, I think it's clear that this work of art speaks to the human need for personal space and introspection, and the desire to feel secure in our own thoughts and convictions.
## 4. Which parts/aspects/elements of this piece of art do you enjoy the most?
I was particularly drawn to the use of color and abstract graphicsï¼ˆas first two figures). I believe that incorporating more abstract elements that appeal to different senses, rather than just sight, could add more depth and meaning to my own work. By blurring the boundaries between different objects with abstract graphics, the audience is encouraged to make their own connections and interpretations.

I can collect feedback from the audience which help me create more interesting and engaging pieces. I could use this feedback to create iterative models, and even consider multi-sensory experiences. For example, by applying different physical materials to a 3D model, making it appear soft and elastic, viewers might associate it with a pillow or a cake, triggering a cascade of associations and emotions. By exploring such abstract and multi-sensory elements, I can create works that are more immersive and thought-provoking.
## 5. Which parts (if any) could have been developed further, according to you?
I would add more physically interactive elements, and sound, to make the space more immersive.
## 6. Which skills does the artist have that distinguish them from other artists?
I dont know about the theory but maybe abstract?
## 7. Does this piece inspire you? If so, how?
As I mentioned in point 4.
## 8. What can you take away from this piece of art? How has studying this piece (potentially) changed your creative practice?
This artwork has made me realize the importance of evoking emotions through artistic creations. However, emotions are complex and I believe that in my future works, I need to pay more attention to the artistic style and visual expression, rather than just the code and mechanics behind it. It's not just about the technical aspects of the work, but also the visual aesthetics that can truly move an audience. By exploring different art styles and visual expressions, I can create works that not only function effectively but also resonate with people on an emotional level.
